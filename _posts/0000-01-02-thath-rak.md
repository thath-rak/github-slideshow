layout: slide
title: "Welcome to the second slide!"
slide 1: Hello, I am Eric Lindburg, the creator of this Intro Slide Pack. Nothing *too* special, I assume. 
slide 2: So, since these slides are supposed to say something about us, I suppose I'll say stuff about myself. 
slide 3: I like to do coding, duh. I'm just generally interested in the technology that surrounds us in our day to day lives- like computers! 
slide 4: Other than that, there isn't much to say. I'd like to keep this short, since not much is needed.
